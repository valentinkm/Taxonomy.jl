# Taxonomy

## What?

Taxonomy.jl aims to serve as a comprehensive database of structural equation models (SEMs) that can be used to infer distributions of both structures (e.g., types of models, numbers of observed and latent variables) and parameters (e.g., what is the average factor loading).
This will greatly facilitate simulation studies that accurately reflect real-world conditions and therefore takes the idea that "Simulation studies are to a statistician what experiments are to a scientist" [Pawel & Kook et al.](https://doi.org/10.1002/bimj.202200091) seriously.
Having a common basis for setting parameters in simulations will also reduce the extremely wide latitude that statisticians have to create an overly positive image of the strengths of novel methods.
So-called researchers-degrees of freedom are already a concern in empirical studies but simulation studies exaggerate the issue by allowing an almost infinite freedom over the data-generating process.
Additionally, Taxonomy.jl will provide a user-friendly interface for researchers to easily sample these parameters for use in their own simulation studies.

### End product

A Julia package that enables filtering a taxonomy database and construct samplers for structure and parameters.
These samplers can quickly be turned into models for [StructuralEquationModels.jl](github.com/StructuralEquationModels/StructuralEquationModels.jl).


## So what?

Simulations are only helpful in so far as they reflect some (simplified) aspects of reality.
A simulation, that is only based on the guess of the researchers conducting it, is prone to fail to represent realistic conditions and may even favour the procedures that are investigated unduly.
Being able to base simulations on a sample of the literature strengthens the inference and practical impact of simulation studies.

### Impact on scientific community

The Julia package will provide an according database and interface, and therefore lower the threshold for the conduction of (better) simulation studies. 
By this, it may enable more general claims and facilitate preregistration of simulations.
Furthermore, Bayesian methodology has highlighted the importance of incorporating prior knowledge in the form of prior distributions.
Taxonomy.jl seeks to make this process more transparent and accessible for researchers and consumers of science, which can greatly facilitate cumulative science.
Besides enabling better simulations, knowing how common different types of SEMs are may greatly help guiding the development of new methodologies.
