AbstractSEM Taxon. 
Taxon for SEM.

    ## Arguments

- `n_sample`: Number of observed cases.
- `n_timepoints`: Number of measurement timepoints.
- `timecoding`: Vector containing the coding of the measurement time points (loadings of the slope onto the timepoints).
- `intercept`: Intercept constant.
- `slope`: Slope constant. 
- `nonlinear_timecoding`: Vector for the timecodings introduced by a nonlinear function. 
- `variance_intercept`: Variance of the intercept.
- `variance_slope`: Variance of the slope. 
- `covariance_intercept_slope`: Covariance between intercept and slope.
- `variances_timepoints`: Vector with variances of the timepoint variables. 
- `n_predictors`: Number of predictors on intercept and slope. 
- `predictor_paths_intercept`: Vector for the predictor-paths to the intercept.
- `predictor_paths_slope`: Vector for the predictor-paths to the slope.
